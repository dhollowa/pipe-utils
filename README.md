DO NOT USE - Under construction.

This package allows Unix commands to be invoked on selections.

Currently only pipe-selection is supported. More to come...

TODO:
  - [ ] pipe selected regions
  - [ ] fix bug with multi-selection state
  - [ ] add tests
  - [ ] add better error reporting with stderr displayed as alert, w/ etch?
  - [ ] config for personal favorites (pinned history)
